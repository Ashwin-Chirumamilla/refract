      "New claims of “inappropriate behaviour” were made against the BBC newsreader Huw Edwards by staff at the broadcaster last night after his wife named him as the presenter at the centre of the explicit pictures scandal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two BBC staff and one former employee told BBC News that they had received what they thought were “inappropriate messages” on social media from the News At Ten anchor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edwards is receiving in-patient hospital care for his mental health after a “serious episode” exacerbated by the events of the past few days, Vicky Flind, his wife, has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "One BBC employee said that they received “suggestive” messages this year from Edwards, 61, that made them feel uncomfortable and awkward.\n",
      "\n",
      "The employee highlighted a power dynamic that made the messages “inappropriate” and called for managers to examine relationship dynamics between presenters and junior staff, something they felt had been ignored, BBC News At 10 reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "The broadcaster said that it had seen the messages, which referred to the staff member’s appearance and “appear to be flirtatious”.\n",
      "\n",
      "BBC Newsnight spoke to the other two employees who say they received inappropriate messages from Edwards. The former employee said they had never met Edwards but had received late-night messages with kisses. They told the programme they believed it was an “abuse of power”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Huw Edwards‘ biggest stories\n",
      "\n",
      "The other employee said they had received messages about their physical appearance, which had given them a “cold shudder”. All three employees mentioned junior staff feeling reluctant to raise their concerns about senior colleagues in case it affected their careers, Newsnight said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A BBC spokesman told The Times: “We always treat the concerns of staff with care, and would always urge any staff members to speak to us if they have any concerns. We have clear processes for making complaints within the organisation, including whistleblowing procedures should someone wish to do so anonymously.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Edwards was identified yesterday as the presenter accused of paying £35,000 to a vulnerable youngster since they were 17 years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five days after the allegations came to light, the Metropolitan Police said it had found no evidence of a criminal offence involving the presenter. It followed a three-day scoping exercise by the force and South Wales police. They spoke to the BBC, the youngster and their family, who have not been identified. Edwards was named by Flind, a television producer, in a 200-word statement shortly before 6pm yesterday after what she described as “five extremely difficult days for our family”.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said that her husband, who has previously struggled with his mental health, had suffered a “serious episode” exacerbated by the events of the past few days. “Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues. As is well documented, he has been treated for severe depression in recent years,” she said. “The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters. He has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving in-patient hospital care, where he’ll stay for the foreseeable future. Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Met said that it had no grounds to conduct an investigation, adding: “Should evidence of criminality or safeguarding issues be identified at any point we would expect matters to be referred to the relevant police force.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Its decision came after the youngster said that “nothing unlawful” had taken place, denying allegations reported in The Sun on Saturday. The newspaper, which is owned by News UK, the parent company of The Times, has stood by its reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three more allegations were later made against Edwards. A second young person told the BBC they felt threatened by the presenter after making contact via a dating app. The individual claimed that Edwards subjected them to abusive expletives when they suggested they might expose him online.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sun then reported claims by a third young person that Edwards allegedly broke lockdown rules to meet them. A fourth anonymous person, also reported by The Sun, suggested that they were contacted by Edwards on Instagram when aged 17. He was said to have sent love hearts and “x” kisses.\n",
